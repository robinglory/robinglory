# üëã Hello, I‚Äôm Robin Glory!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I‚Äôm a passionate, self-driven learner and coder, diving deep into programming, AI, web development, and more. My journey here documents not only the projects I've built but also my study progress across a range of topics that I'm committed to mastering.

## üå± About Me

I‚Äôm currently following structured online courses and learning paths, ranging from foundational programming to advanced AI. I use my GitHub to document my learning, share code solutions, and keep a record of my growth. Whether I‚Äôm brushing up on Python or exploring new technologies, this profile serves as my interactive coding journal.

Here‚Äôs a look at some of the learning paths and projects I‚Äôm working on:

### üìö Learning Projects
- **[LearningCS50Python](https://github.com/robinglory/LearningCS50Python)**: My study notes, code, and reflections from the **CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python** course. This course is a deep dive into Python for beginners, and I‚Äôm determined to complete every module and master the basics.
  
- **[AI_for_Everyone](https://github.com/robinglory/AI_for_Everyone)**: Following along with Paul McWhorter's YouTube series on AI, this repo contains my exercises, notes, and code implementations. It‚Äôs my introduction to AI and a stepping stone toward deeper studies in machine learning.

- **[w3school-git](https://github.com/robinglory/w3school-git)**: A journal documenting my journey to re-learn Git through **w3school** tutorials. I'm using this repo to solidify my version control skills, which I consider essential for a clean and efficient workflow.

- **[Uopeople](https://github.com/robinglory/Uopeople)**: Files and study resources from my time studying at the University of the People, where I worked on numerous Python exercises and assignments.

### üõ†Ô∏è Web Development & Front-End Projects

I‚Äôm continuously building and experimenting with front-end development projects to sharpen my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. Here are some highlights:

- **[Cobalt16](https://github.com/robinglory/Cobalt16)**: A project that uses PHP, showcasing server-side development techniques.
  
- **[Simple_Nuclear_Quiz](https://github.com/robinglory/Simple_Nuclear_quiz)**: This project, created for the **Hackatom** event, is a prototype of a nuclear quiz application using JavaScript.

- **[Only_Bootstrap_Website](https://github.com/robinglory/Only_Bootstrap_Website)**: This website uses only Bootstrap to build a responsive and stylish layout.

- **[WebDevFreeCourses](https://github.com/robinglory/WebDevFreeCourses)**: A curated collection of resources for affordable and valuable web development courses.

### üìà Experimenting with GitHub

Beyond learning from courses, I also explore GitHub‚Äôs full capabilities:

- **[awesome-github-profile-readme](https://github.com/robinglory/awesome-github-profile-readme)**: A curated list of GitHub profile README ideas and designs for inspiration.

- **[robinglory](https://github.com/robinglory/robinglory)**: Configuration files and GitHub profile setup files, which I use to customize my GitHub profile.

### üí° Mini Projects & Practice Repositories

I believe practice makes perfect, so I often create mini-projects and quick exercises. Some examples include:

- **[Random_Choice_Picker](https://github.com/robinglory/Random_Choice_Picker)**: A JavaScript-based app that lets users input choices and then picks a random option‚Äîuseful for everyday decisions!
  
- **[Day_9_Sound_Board](https://github.com/robinglory/Day_9_Sound_Board)**, **[Day_8_Form_Wave_Animation](https://github.com/robinglory/Day_8_Form_Wave_Animation)**, and **[Day_7_Split_Landing_Pages](https://github.com/robinglory/Day7_Split_Landing_Pages)**: These projects are part of my ‚Äú50 Days, 50 Projects‚Äù challenge to practice web development fundamentals.
